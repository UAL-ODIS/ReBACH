## Summary

This dataset supports the associated publication "Precipitation temporal repackaging into fewer, larger storms delayed seasonal timing of peak photosynthesis in a semi-arid grassland" https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.13980. 

It includes 1) weekly plot-level flux, 2) _Digitaria californica_ reproductive culm, 3) community structure for five blocks (H1-H5) and four precipitation treatments (S1-S4). Each block consists of a rainout shelter (itself consisting of four randomized plots). Precipitation treatments consist of
- 3.5 days dry interval (S1)
- 7 days dry interval (S2)
- 14 days dry interval (S3)
- 21 days dry interval (S4)
