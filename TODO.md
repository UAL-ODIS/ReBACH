# ReDATA DART Preservation Tool
This tool implements the "last mile" of ReDATA's preservation strategy by
ingesting a data/metadata package, generating a preservation-ready bag using
the APTrust DART tool, and uploading the completed bag to offsite storage.

### Testing
- [ ] Generate test data from sample data

### Metadata Integration
- [ ] Construct metadata tags from metadata file

### Deployment
- If dart-runner not found, print message and point user to where to locate it
  - Do not attempt to download it
  - Add to documentation: how to download, where to put, how to set executable permission
